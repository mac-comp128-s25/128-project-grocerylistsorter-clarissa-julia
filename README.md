# Grocery List Sorter

Created by Julia Prewitt and Clarissa Sigale for COMP 128 Spring 2025

# Explanation of Project
This project was inspired by our mom's who would often rewrite their grocery lists to sort them by section of the store. This organizer does that, but in a more advanced way by getting the price and exact product at a specific store using an Amazon/Whole Foods API. 

# What is Needed
In order to run this code you need to have Java up to date as of 5/12/24. You also need to have a key for your API. For the grading period, our key will remain active for use, but after 5/15/25 you will need to obtain your own API key and update the code with it. You can access the API we utilized [here](https://rapidapi.com/mahmudulhasandev/api/api-to-find-grocery-prices). 

You may have to install new dependencies into your gradle as well for this project to run as intended. See our gradle page in the project for what dependencies are needed

# Research
For this project we did research on how to implement API's and JavaSwing, etc. You can access the links we utilized [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15yGyO9L3vmY5hZ1z4SdTQSsAi0ERV95XBWaF1yDd0tk/edit?tab=t.jt5wgfoid0sw).
